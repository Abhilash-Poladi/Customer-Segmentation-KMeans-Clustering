# Customer-Segmentation-KMeans-Clustering

This is customer segmentation basis customer's spending score, annual income. We use K Means clustering to implement this segmentation.

Hyperparameter tuning:

We plot a graph for Inertia ( Within cluster sum of squares) vs K to indetify K which minimizes WCSS. K=5 is the best hyper parameter that decreases the WCSS
